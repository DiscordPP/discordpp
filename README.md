* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (If using a Beast module)
* [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org)
* A Discord++ REST module
    * [REST: Simple-Web-Server](https://github.com/DiscordPP/rest-simpleweb)

* [nlohmann::json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)
* [Asio](https://github.com/chriskohlhoff/asio/) (You can remove the submodule if Asio is being provided by Boost)

### Recommended Plugins

* [Plugin: RateLimit](https://github.com/DiscordPP/plugin-ratelimit) handes rate limiting
    * Without this plugin, Discord++ exits when encountering a rate limit for your safety
* [Plugin: Overload](https://github.com/DiscordPP/plugin-overload) provides overloads for the websocket  `send` function
  to create `std::shared_ptr`s for you and provides some sane defaults when you don't need all their arguments.
* [Plugin: Responder](https://github.com/DiscordPP/plugin-responder) provides a simple interface for detecting commands
  in the form of a character and a string, e.g. `!help`
* [Plugin: Native](https://github.com/DiscordPP/plugin-netive) provides extensions to the default `call`
  , `callJson`, and `callFile` methods specific to different endpoints as well as native C++ objects for Discord's JSON structures
* You can find more plugins on the [#discordpp-plugin](https://github.com/topics/discordpp-plugin) tag
